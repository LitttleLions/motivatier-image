# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on configuring automated deployment for the image storage service on Plesk. The user has opted for the "Direct Python Application Deployment" method to leverage Plesk's built-in Git integration for automated updates and application restarts upon GitHub push events.

## Recent Changes
- Updated `progress.md` to reflect completed tasks and the current deployment strategy.
- Resolved previous frontend and backend issues, confirming drag-and-drop upload functionality is working.

## Next Steps
- Provide detailed instructions to the user for setting up direct Python application deployment on Plesk with GitHub integration. (Completed in previous message)
- Update `memory-bank/progress.md` and `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to document the chosen deployment method and the provided instructions. (This current step)
- Confirm with the user if they have successfully implemented the deployment steps or if further assistance is needed.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The "Direct Python Application Deployment" method is chosen for its simplicity and direct integration with Plesk's Git features, avoiding the complexities of Docker automation for now.
- The `plesk-setup-guide.md` provides the necessary steps for this setup.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Plesk offers robust built-in support for Python applications and Git integration, simplifying automated deployments for non-Dockerized setups.
- Clear communication with the user regarding deployment options is crucial to ensure the chosen path aligns with their technical environment and preferences.
