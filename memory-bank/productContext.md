# Product Context: Mini-Bild-Speicherservice – “lovable” Edition

## Why this project exists
The project aims to provide a simple, easy-to-use image storage solution that avoids the complexities and overhead of traditional database-backed systems. It caters to users who need quick image uploads and direct access URLs without extensive setup or maintenance.

## Problems it solves
*   **Complexity of image storage**: Eliminates the need for database configuration and management for image metadata.
*   **Slow image workflows**: Provides immediate access to image URLs after upload, streamlining content integration.
*   **High maintenance overhead**: Designed for minimal administrative effort, making it suitable for small teams or individuals.

## How it should work (User Perspective)
1.  **Homepage**: User lands on a start page displaying a folder tree.
2.  **Folder Selection**: User selects an existing folder or creates a new one.
3.  **Upload**: Images can be uploaded via drag-and-drop or a file dialog.
4.  **Post-Upload**: After upload, a thumbnail, editable original name, and a public URL with a "Copy" button appear.
5.  **Mass Uploads**: Option to repeat mass uploads.

## User Experience Goals ("Lovability")
*   **Immediate Feedback**: Users should see their uploaded images appear instantly.
*   **One-Click Actions**: Key actions like copying URLs should be simple and provide visual confirmation.
*   **Contextual Guidance**: Information like size limits and allowed formats should be visible where needed.
*   **Clear Error Messages**: Errors should be human-readable and actionable, not technical codes.
*   **Minimalist Aesthetic**: The UI should be clean, friendly, and free of jargon, with consistent typography and ample whitespace.
